# Simplifying Big O Expressions

 - When Determining the time complexity of an algorithm, there are some helpful rule of thumbs for big O expressions.
 - These rules of thumb are consequences of the definition of big O notation.


# Space Complexity

- Most primitives (booleans, number,undefined,null) are constant space.
- Strings require o(n) space (where n is the string length).
- Reference types are generally o(n), where n isthe length (for arrays) or the number of keys (for objects)
