# 🚀 Master These 7 Algorithm Patterns — Level Up Your Problem Solving! 👨‍💻👩‍💻

Whether you’re cracking coding interviews or designing scalable systems, these 7 patterns are must-know tools in your dev toolkit 🧠🧰:

---

## 🔁 1. Frequency Counter

Efficiently count elements.  
Think of it as a smart way to avoid nested loops.  
**Great for:** comparing strings, arrays, and more.

---

## ➡️ 2. Multiple Pointers

One array. Two (or more) pointers.  
Move smartly.  
**Reduces time complexity** from `O(n²)` to `O(n)` — especially in **sorted arrays**.

---

## 📦 3. Sliding Window

Perfect for “longest,” “maximum,” or “minimum” in subarrays.  
Keep the window moving and optimize!

---

## 🧩 4. Divide and Conquer

Break it. Solve it. Combine it.  
Used in **Merge Sort**, **Binary Search** — and many real-world recursive problems.

---

## 📈 5. Dynamic Programming (DP)

Solve complex problems by **remembering past results**.  
Key to tackling optimization problems like **knapsack**, **paths**, and more.

---

## 💰 6. Greedy Algorithms

Make the best choice at every step.  
Simple, fast, and effective — but **watch out: not always optimal**!

---

## 🌀 7. Backtracking

Explore every possible path.  
Think **Sudoku solvers**, **permutations**, and **recursive decision trees**.
